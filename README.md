# Employees
Application properties file includes configuration details (including data base and table name).
I used MySQL Workbench to create a database and PostMan to check if my application’ methods work properly (thanks to that application it is possible to check all http methods). 
A default address is localhost:8080. If it doesn’t work it is needed to add in application properties server.port=6060 (or different).
